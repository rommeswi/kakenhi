Mirror of KAKENHI LaTeX

This is a mirror of the LaTeX files provided by
http://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kakenhiLaTeX/

The motivation for this repository is to allow for easier contribution to the KAKENHI LaTeX files.
This will make it easier to create and maintain English language versions, and versions that rely
on packages such as standalone.
